# Implementation of simple linked-list in C++ 
The SimpleLinkedList.h file contains all the basic operations perfermable on a simple linked list (add, add_last, pop, pop_last, ...). They are implemented in the SimpleLinkedList.cpp file.

All these functions are already implemented in C++, so I do this just to understand what's underneath and for fun ;)

## How to compile and run it ?

    make

This will create all binaries (one for each data structure) at the same time in a directory called "bin".

Just go in that directory, and run a binary file to see its working
