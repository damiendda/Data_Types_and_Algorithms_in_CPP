# Data Types and Algorithms in C++

Why ?

The goal is to implement the most known data types and algorithms in C++ so to master them better. Any suggestion of improvement is welcome.

Here are the fields that will be covered :
    - Linked-Lists, Queues & Stacks
    - Trees & Heaps
    - Searching (linear, binary)
    - Sorting (selection, inertion, bubble, quick, merge)
